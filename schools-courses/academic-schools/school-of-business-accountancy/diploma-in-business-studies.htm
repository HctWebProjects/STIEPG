<p><strong>New Business Sustainability &amp; Digitalisation Track</strong><br></p><p>Many organisations are catching the green vision, with leading global companies showing the way by adopting sustainable business practices. The BS course launched the Business Sustainability &amp; Digitalisation track to prepare students to tap these opportunities. Embedded into the curriculum are the 3 pillars of sustainability - Economic, Environment and Social – and their applications with the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) framework to create enterprise value.</p>


<h2 id="further-studies">Further Studies</h2><p>The BS diploma is recognised by all local  and many overseas universities, with many of them granting module exemptions. Our graduates enjoy at least one year’s exemption at many universities in Australia and the United Kingdom.&nbsp;<br><br>In partnership with the Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP), all BS students specialising in Human Capital Management will now have an opportunity to graduate as an IHRP-Certified Associate. This will provide them with a structured pathway to becoming an IHRP-Certified Professional.<br></p>
