            <strong>DE Experience<br></strong>This module is a week-long intense exposure to the aspects of Design, Sustainability and Technology in the Design and Built Environment industries. Students will gain an understanding to the fundamentals
of sustainability and the application of technology using Human Centric Design methodology to propose solutions to the sustainability challenges. Students will have the opportunity to collaborate with other DE students from different courses and this
will allow them to understand the common sustainability goals and challenges in the Design &amp; Built Environment industries.
<p><br><br><strong>History &amp; Principles of Design</strong></p>This module provides students a deeper understanding of how design theory and history have been formulated worldwide in relation to the development of modern society. The module
provides students with a historical perspective of design against the backdrop of developments in culture, art and technology.<br><br>Students will learn about design movements and iconic design works. The module also covers elements and principles
of design such as points, lines, planes, textures and space and the concepts of balance, proportion, symmetry, and contrast etc. Theory of functionality of design and principles of culture, timeline, art/architecture/design movements will be covered.<br><br><br><p><strong>Design Foundation Studio </strong></p>In a design studio-based learning environment, this module facilitates the development of critical thinking and fundamental design principles relating to industrial/product and architectural
